      How would you compare Next.js with another framework? Feel free to compare with a framework of your choice

        Next.js to me is similar to <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">Gatsby</a>. I used gatsby a bit when I was wanting to make a professional website for myself. I found that gatsby was great for static sites but when I wanted to add more dynamic content it was a bit of a pain. It seems like next.js is a bit more flexible in that regard. 
        I have also been impressed with next.js in that it is very easy to get started with. I have been able to get a site up and running in a matter of minutes and the documentation is very easy to follow. Another thing that next.js seems to be better at than gatsby is the ability to use typescript. I have been using typescript for a while now and I love it.
        I think for my professional website I will pivot and actually use next.js instead of gatsby.
