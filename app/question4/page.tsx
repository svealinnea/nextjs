        Hello, 

        I would be happy to assist you with that. 

        I am curious what steps you have taken so far to try and redirect the /blog path to another website?

        If there is something specific in your workflow that is not working I would be happy to help you troubleshoot that.

        If you are just looking for information on how to do that I am happy to send that information over to you.

        Looking forward to your response, 

        Svea
